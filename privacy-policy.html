  <!-- =================== Pocket Register =================== -->
  <h2 id="pocket-register">Pocket Register – Privacy Policy</h2>

  <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>Pocket Register does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. The app functions entirely on your device, and your data remains under your control.</p>

  <h3>2. Advertising</h3>
  <p>Pocket Register uses Google AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect certain non-personally identifiable information (e.g., device identifiers, approximate location, and ad interaction data) to provide personalized and non-personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device settings.</p>

  <h3>3. In-App Purchases</h3>
  <p>The app offers an optional in-app purchase to remove ads. Purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. We do not have access to your payment details.</p>

  <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device. We do not transmit your data to external servers.</p>

  <h3>5. Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

  <h3>6. Contact Us</h3>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:

  <!-- =================== Shot2File =================== -->
  <h2 id="shot2file">Shot2File – Privacy Policy</h2>

  <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
  <p>Shot2File saves photos, videos, and scans directly to folders you choose in the Files app (including iCloud Drive). The app itself does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to our servers—there are no accounts and no cloud backends operated by us.</p>

  <h3>2. Device Permissions & How They’re Used</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera</strong> — capture photos, videos, and document scans.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone</strong> — record audio with video (video mode only).</li>
    <li><strong>Photo Library</strong> — <em>optional</em>, used only when you choose Batch Import to copy selected photos into your target Files folder.</li>
    <li><strong>Files/Storage</strong> — write media to your selected folder using security-scoped bookmarks. The app does not read other folders without your selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Location</strong> — <em>optional</em>, if enabled, we embed location in EXIF metadata and/or filenames. You can change this anytime in iOS Settings ▸ Privacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. On-Device Processing</h3>
  <p>Document scanning and OCR (text recognition) are performed on device using Apple frameworks. We do not upload your scans for processing.</p>

  <h3>4. Advertising</h3>
  <p>When Pro is not active, Shot2File shows ads via Google AdMob, including rewarded ads that can temporarily unlock Pro features. AdMob may collect non-personally identifiable information such as device identifiers, approximate location, and ad interaction data to provide personalized and non-personalized ads. You can control ad personalization in your device settings.</p>

  <h3>5. In-App Purchases & Temporary Pro</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Permanent Pro</strong> — a one-time purchase that removes ads and unlocks Pro features.</li>
    <li><strong>Rewarded “Try Pro”</strong> — watching a short ad grants temporary access to many Pro features. <em>Note:</em> rewarded access does <strong>not</strong> permanently unlock additional Favorites; limits may apply once temporary access ends.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All purchases are processed by Apple’s App Store. We do not have access to your payment details.</p>

  <h3>6. Data Security & Retention</h3>
  <p>Media you create or import is written directly to the folder you choose. Your files remain under your control in the Files app/iCloud Drive. We do not transmit your files to our servers.</p>

  <h3>7. Children’s Privacy</h3>
  <p>Our apps are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page with a revised effective date.</p>

  <h3>9. Contact Us</h3>
  <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:
